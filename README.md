# Social-Network-Connection-Checker-Graph
Application Name: Social Network Connection Checker

INTRODUCING:
This Java application demonstrates the use of a graph data structure to model a social network and determine if a connection exists between two individuals.
WHAT IT CAN DO:
Represent a social network
Check for connections
Display the results



Why I made this application :
This application provides a practical example of graph traversals, specifically BFS, which is a fundamental algorithm in computer science with applications in many areas beyond social networks (e.g., network routing, searching).

Contribution:
Educational Resource: The code provides a clear and concise implementation of a graph traversal algorithm (Breadth-First Search) using Java. This is beneficial for students, beginners in programming, or anyone learning about graph data structures and algorithms.  It demonstrates core concepts like adjacency lists, queues, and sets in a practical context.
